# python-challenge
The final test of week 3 of the Berkely Data Analyst Bootcamp. Topic:  " A deeper dive into Python"

I've used Xpert Learning Assistant, chat gtp, and the solution files for days 1, 2, and 3 of the Python activities. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the Pybank budget analysis.
#update: all the documents, including Pybank Budget analysis, have been updated later in the evening of the deadline date.
All required documents for the test are now available.
